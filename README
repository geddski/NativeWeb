This is an example application demonstrating how to build Native Web applications.

When working with the build tool, cd into the baseUrl directory (components, in this case). 

To speed up testing your built app, you can delete your build directory with this (rename to your build dir):
rm -rf ../../nativeweb-build/

To build with node (much faster):
../../requirejs-0.24.0/build/build.sh app.build.js

To build with Java:
../../requirejs-0.24.0/build/buildj.sh app.build.js
